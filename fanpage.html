        <h1>Bio</h1>

        <p>
            BORN from the BELLY of the BEAST Compton, CA, USA. Kendrick Lamar has overcome circumstances the average person couldn't conceptualize. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            As the best rapper alive, he delivers powerful and deep concepts with a quick and witty punch. He has both exceptional lyrical content and story-telling skills.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Kendrick is often misunderstood as another rapper from California, that is until you listen to his albums front to back. You will discover a true audio experience that takes you on a wild ride of atmospheric sounds, "punchy" beats, and thought provoking political themes.
        </p>

        I recommend <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/kendrick-lamar-the-rolling-stone-interview-199817/" target="_blank">this interview</a> on Rolling Stone's website to understand Kendrick not only as an artist, but a person.
